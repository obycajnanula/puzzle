this engaging code is developed by nula jedna and vermachti. you are not allowd tu pull'r dull.

the more we learn about the world, and the deeper our learning, the more conscious, specific, 
adn articulate will be our knowledge of what we do not know, our knowledge of our ignorance. 
For this, indeed, is the main source of our ignorance - the fact that our knowledge can only 
be finite, while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite.....it might be well for all of us 
to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite 
ignorance we are all equal

"there is no criterion of truth at our disposal, and this fact supports pessimism. but we 
do possess criteria which, if we are lucky, may allow us to recognize error and falsity. 
clarity and distinctness are not criteria of truth, but such things as obscurity or confusion 
may indicate error. similarly coherence cannot establish truth, but incoherence and inconsistency 
do establish falsehood. and when they are recognized, our own errors provide the dim red lights 
which help is in goruping our way out of the darkness of our cave."

"knowledge cannot start from nothin - from a tabula rasa - not yet from observation. the advance 
of knoledge consists, mainly, in the modification of earlier knowledge. although we may sometimes, 
for example in archaeology, advance through a chance observation, the significance of the discovery 
will usually depend upon its power to modify our earlier theories."

nothing is true, everything is permitted
